## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elastic-mesh-simulation.git
cd elastic-mesh-simulation

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from elastic_mesh.simulation import ElasticMeshSimulation

# Create a simulation with custom space dimensions
sim = ElasticMeshSimulation(space_size=(50, 50, 30))

# Run the simulation with real-time visualization
sim.run()
```

## üéÆ Advanced Usage

### Custom Drone Configurations

```python
from elastic_mesh.core import ElasticMesh
import numpy as np

# Initialize the mesh environment
mesh = ElasticMesh(space_size=(50, 50, 30))

# Add drones with specific start and goal positions
mesh.add_drone(
    drone_id="scout_1",
    start=np.array([10, 10, 5]),
    goal=np.array([40, 40, 25])
)

# Configure mesh parameters
mesh.k_spring = 0.6  # Adjust spring constant
mesh.max_connection_distance = 10.0  # Modify connection range
```

### Weather Pattern Customization

```python
# Create custom weather patterns
weather_grid = np.zeros((10, 10, 5))
weather_grid[5:8, 5:8, 2:4] = 1.0  # Create a storm cell

mesh.weather_grid = weather_grid
```
